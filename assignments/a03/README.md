## Part 1. Cyber and Physical Attack Types

:interrobang: Question 1 - In your own words, describe each of the below attack types (objective/goal and how they work (in general)). Please provide protection strategies against these attacks in your response:


<table border="0">
 <tr>
    <td><b style="font-size:30px"></b></td>
    <td><b style="font-size:30px"></b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Privilege Escalation <br> DNS Poisoning <br> Domain Hijacking <br> Zero-day <br> Client Hijacking <br> Evil Twins </td>
    <td>Driver Manipulation <br> Spoofing <br> Wireless Replay <br> Rogue Access Points <br> Wireless Jamming <br> WPS Attacks</td>
 </tr>
</table>

It's important to recognize that many of these attacks can be used together to devastate a system. A RAT can be used to install a backdoor, allowing for a threat actor to pivot, escalate their privilege level and then poison your DNS server to send you to a spoofed website to capture your credentials. These attacks will usually work together to achieve a specific goal.  Thinking about how these attacks work together and what we can do to interrupt them is an important part of cyber defense.

:interrobang: Question 2 - Compare and contrast DNS Poisoning and Domain Hijacking. <br>

:interrobang: Question 3 - What general security advice would your give a new company looking to start a cyber security/malware defense program? Justify your suggestions / claims. <br>

:interrobang: Question 4 - According to the book what percentage of attacks are from buffer overflow? <br>

:interrobang: Question 5 - Provide an example of typo-squatting. <br>

:interrobang: Question 6 - Why are rogue AP's a clever way to deliver a man in the middle attack? <br>

:interrobang: Question 7 - What are the advantages of performing a password or WPS IV crack "offline"? <br>

:interrobang: Question 8 - Describe the security concerns associated with the below logo: <br>

:interrobang: Question 9 - What is click-hijacking? <br>

:interrobang: Question 10 - Assume you connect to an evil twin SSID. What security measure would protect you from threat actors collecting your sensitive network traffic? <br>

:interrobang: Question 11 - What is horizontal privilege escalation? What type of concerns does it pose (security, privacy, both) and why? <br>

:interrobang: Question 12 - Why would a threat actor choose to infect a computers driver? <br>

:interrobang: Question 13 - Why is signature based detection largely ineffective against polymorphic and metamorphic malware? <br>

:interrobang: Question 14 - What cyber attack cycle is illustrated in the below timeline: <br>
