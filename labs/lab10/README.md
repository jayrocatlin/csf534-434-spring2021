## Part 1 - What Is Risk?

The below language is simply pulled from www.immersivelabs.com for your convenience. Please, read the information below and complete the [What Is Risk?](https://immersivelabs.online/labs/what-is-risk/category/knowledge/series/risk) lab on immersive labs.

### Quick Summary

Risk is defined as:

'The potential that a given threat will exploit vulnerabilities of an asset or group of assets and thereby cause harm to the organisation. It is measured in terms of a combination of the probability of occurrence of an event and its consequence.'

Risk is the impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability to adversely affect an asset.

In this module we will introduce the theory and concepts of risk.

## Part 2 - How Is Risk Measured?

The below language is simply pulled from www.immersivelabs.com for your convenience. Please, read the information below and complete the [How Is Risk Measured?](https://immersivelabs.online/labs/how-is-risk-measured/category/knowledge/series/risk) lab on immersive labs.


### Quick Summary

Mitigating risk takes time and money, so organizations have to measure, then prioritize, how much effort they apply against each risk. To measure risk, organizations must consider both the impact and probability of a risk occurring.

In this lab we will give you an overview of how risk is calculated and how businesses begin to measure it.

## Part 3. Quantitative Risk Measurement?

The below language is simply pulled from www.immersivelabs.com for your convenience. Please, read the information below and complete the [Quantitative Risk Measurement?](https://immersivelabs.online/labs/quantitative-risk-measurement/category/knowledge/series/risk) lab on immersive labs.

### Quick Summary

When an organization wants to carry out a quantitative risk measurement, it must allocate a figure to all variables that go into making the risk calculation. In this lab we will explore how quantitative risk measurement is achieved and the components required in its calculation.

## Part 4. Qualitative Risk Measurement?

The below language is simply pulled from www.immersivelabs.com for your convenience. Please, read the information below and complete the [Qualitative Risk Measurement?](https://immersivelabs.online/labs/qualitative-risk-measurement/category/knowledge/series/risk) lab on immersivelabs.

### Quick Summary

Risk measurement is a function of the probability of an event occurring and the impact it has on the asset in question.

In this module we will explore how qualitative risk measurement is done and the components that need to be included in its calculation.

## Part 5: Order of Volatility

The below language is simply pulled from www.immersivelabs.com for your convenience. Please, read the information below and complete the [Order of Volatility](https://immersivelabs.online/labs/order-of-volatility/category/defensive/series/digital-forensics) lab on immersivelabs.

### Quick Summary

When collecting evidence for a forensic investigation, it is important to make sure you collect everything you need and do so in the correct order; the order of collection can have an impact on recoverable evidence.
