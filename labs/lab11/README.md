# Lab 11 - Tabletop Disaster Response Exercise

The table of contents for this lab is found below.

Part 1. Disaster Response Report <br>
Part 2. Submission <br>

This week, we spoke a lot about disaster response planning and techniques that we can use to improve our preparedness for environmental threats.  

## Part 1 - Scenario Description

You are a security administrator for the RI CyberMart Stores. The RI CyberMart Stores has two (2) large sites. The corporate office is in Providence, Rhode Island and the manufacturing site is in Cleveland, Ohio. In addition, the RI CyberMart Stores has five (5) smaller sites.

At the Corporate site, you currently have eight (8) physical Hyper-V hosts that host approximately one hundred twenty (120) virtual machines. The virtual machines are running Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012. The servers are needed to host email, various databases, file services, print services, and a point-of sales-application. The virtual machines are stored on a centrally located storage area network (SAN) that has multiple power supplies, and use redundant array of independent disks (RAID).

Over the last three (3) years, you have had two (2) power failures that caused the servers to go down at the corporate office. Recently, during one (1) of these incidents, files on one (1) of the servers were corrupted. It was later discovered that the backup could only partially restore the data files, but could not restore the server itself.

The servers must remain available and reliable. As the administrator, you must ensure that you can recover from a failure or problem quickly with minimum loss.

Develop a continuity plan / disaster recovery plan for RI CyberMart Stores in which you address the following:

* Suggest an approach that provides redundancy (failover) for all mission critical functions in the event of a disaster including power failure. Consider the following in your approach: Essential Infrastructure; Email; Database; File Services; Print Services; Point-of-Sale Applications; Power Redundancy Solutions.
* Identify the changes that should be made to the backup procedures in order to address the problem with the server backups.
* Outline the necessary actions that Server Administrators must verify for proper operation of servers in the event of a failover.
* Provide a plan for returning all services back to the primary systems once the crisis has passed.
* Examine the pros and cons of moving part of the data center to the Cleveland office and housing it there on a permanent basis. Provide your recommendation for the stated action.

#### Important Considerations

Your disaster response plan should:

* Demonstrate the ability to describe, manage, and configure load balancing and failover clustering.
* Demonstrate the ability to configure and manage backups to include role-specific and online or cloud environments.
* Demonstrate the ability to recover servers to include files and volumes.
* Use technology and information resources to research issues in advanced network infrastructure environments.
* Write clearly and concisely about advanced network infrastructure topics using proper writing mechanics and technical style conventions.


Feel free to use online resources / templates for inspiration. Be sure to cite any resources and templates that you do use.

:warning: Your document will be graded on completeness, accuracy, and formatting. You should use all of the disaster recovery plan elements that we discussed this week in your report.

Expected report length should fall between 3 - 5 pages.
