### Quick Summary

Bloomberg reported on supposed interference with the supply chain for servers used in data centres across the US. It's reported that a malicious chip that allows interaction with the server's Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) was discovered in 2015. In this lab, we introduce the capabilities of the BMC and a tool that can be used to interact with it.
